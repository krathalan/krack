Description: Timer for krack-build - continuous build system for Arch for %I
Documentation=man:krack(1)

# This timer will activate 2 minutes after boot. The timer will re-trigger 20
# hours AFTER krack-build finishes its build cycle. The timer is persistent,
# meaning a rebuild won't happen every reboot, but only on the 20-hour cycle.
