Todo:
- Support packages compressed with programs other than zstd
- More intelligently build git packages
- Last build cycle report: during a build cycle, save status of each package to file (e.g. "up-to-date/not built, built successfully, etc") and allow user to see with `krackctl report`
- krackctl remove-package: for removing pkgbuild dir, cached package(s), and failure logs all in one command

Done:
Fixed log compression

Added save last build time of package and report it when building a new package.

Added a feature that saves each output of makechrootpkg to a temporary log file. If the build fails, move the temp log to a permanent directory and give it a unique build fail ID for reference in important messages and journalctl -p err messages.
