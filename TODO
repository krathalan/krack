Todo:
Save last build time of package and report it when building a new package.

Done:
Add a feature that saves each output of makechrootpkg to a temporary log file. If the build fails, move the temp log to a permanent directory and give it a unique build fail ID for reference in important messages and journalctl -p err messages.
