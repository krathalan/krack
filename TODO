Todo:
Last build cycle report: during a build cycle, save status of each package to file (e.g. "up-to-date/not built, built successfully, etc") and allow user to see with `krackctl report`

Done:
Save last build time of package and report it when building a new package.

Add a feature that saves each output of makechrootpkg to a temporary log file. If the build fails, move the temp log to a permanent directory and give it a unique build fail ID for reference in important messages and journalctl -p err messages.
